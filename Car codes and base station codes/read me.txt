These codes are for our project :  

the folder "Car codes and base station codes" contains three sketches for Arduino codes :
1 - nrf24_client : is the sketch for the base station Arduino. 
2 - nrf24_server: is the sketch for the leader Vehicle 
3 - nrf24_server_follower  : is the sketch for the follower Vehicle 

the folder "StopSignDetector" : 
It is a C# EMGU CV (OpenCV) that detects the Octgon shape of the stop sign and filter the red color, then it detects the stop word inside it.
The application also communicate with the arduino that has the RF transciver to send the commands to the leader car. The user should choose the COM port # to enbale the camera options.
Once the camera options are enabled, the user should enter the correct IP address of the Raspberry pi, then press the Capture button.
